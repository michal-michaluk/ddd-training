Editing Delivery Plan:
At end of his work day (around 16:00), Logistician prepares delivery plan
for next day (plan include night shift of next day).
Plan for today (including night shift) was prepared day before.

Software supports Logistician while planning, by:
- checking payload size against Transport Capacity (capacity exceeded),
- continuously checking Plan Completeness against customers demands for that day.

Transport Capacity:
each transport type (truck etc.) defines its capacity expressed by
amount of euro palette fitting in it.

There are 3 different types of Storage Units:
*euro palette* - capacity defined explicitly for transport type,
*cages* - with same size like euro palette, but two cages can be stocked one on another,
so for transport with capacity od 22 euro pallets we can fit 44 cages,
*trailers* - 10 trailers can be transported in standard 22 palette transport size,
no other transport types are leveraged for trailers delivery.

Plan Completeness:
Plan change recalculates plan completeness by taking into account:
- parts amound currently planed in deliveries,
- current demands expressed in parts amount,
- the remainder (not fulfilled demands for product from last plan).

For each Product following information is configurable:
- preferred transport type and its capacity,
- storage unit type used for storage and transport,
- amount of product per storage unit.

Completing the Plan:
Before completion, plan should fulfill demands.
In other case, confirmation for each product need to be taken:
confirm customer acceptance: „deliver part next day” or „reduce todays demand”
the remainder is left for next plan accordingly or demands should be adjusted.
Over planning to 1 full storage unit per transport is acceptable.
After completing:
Emails for each spedition company should be send.
Email should contain information about each delivery:
- arrival time at our location,
- transport type,
- delivery location.
Pick Lists and Loading Schedule should be generated for warehous crew.

Preferences per product:
- storage unit type
- parts amount per storage unit
- typical delivery location
- preferred transport type
- preferred spedition company
