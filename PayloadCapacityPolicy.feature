Feature: Payload capacity policy

  Transport Capacity info:
  each transport type (truck etc.) defines its capacity expressed by
  amount of euro palette fitting in it.

  There are 3 different types of Storage Units:
  *euro palette* - capacity defined explicitly for transport type,
  *cages* - with same size like euro palette, but two cages can be stocked one on another,
  so for transport with capacity od 22 euro pallets we can fit 44 cages,
  *trailers* - 10 trailers can be transported in standard 22 palette transport size,
  no other transport types are leveraged for trailers delivery.


  Scenario: Full truck
    Given "truck" of capacity 22
    Given payload contains 22 palette
    When Capacity Policy is checked
    Then capacity is not exceeded


  Scenario: Full truck, one pallet over capacity
    Given "truck" of capacity 22
    Given payload contains 23 palette
    When Capacity Policy is checked
    Then capacity is exceeded with 1 palette


  Scenario Outline: scenarios for palettes
    Given "<transport>" of capacity <capacity>
    Given payload contains <palette> palette
    When Capacity Policy is checked
    Then capacity is exceeded with <overPallets> palette

    Examples:
      | transport | capacity | palette | overPallets |
      | truck     | 22       | 10      | 0           |
      | truck     | 22       | 22      | 0           |
      | truck     | 22       | 23      | 1           |
      | truck     | 22       | 25      | 3           |
      | truck     | 33       | 25      | 0           |
      | truck     | 33       | 32      | 0           |
      | truck     | 33       | 33      | 0           |
      | truck     | 33       | 35      | 2           |


  Scenario Outline: Verify payload capacity policy
    Given "<transport>" of capacity <capacity>
    Given payload contains <palette> palette
    Given payload contains <cages> cages
    Given payload contains <trailers> trailers
    When Capacity Policy is checked
    Then capacity is exceeded with <overPallets> palette
    Then capacity is exceeded with <overCages> cages
    Then capacity is exceeded with <overTrailers> trailers

      | transport | capacity | palette | cages | trailers | overPallets | overCages | overTrailers |
